<strong>Decentralized Certificate Verification Platform</strong>

<span>A blockchain-based certification system that connects Learning Management Systems (LMS) with verifiable NFT certificates through oracle integration</span>

</div>

## Overview

DELOK is a comprehensive dApp that bridges traditional Learning Management Systems with blockchain technology. It enables students to obtain verifiable NFT certificates for completed courses, with grades and certificates stored on IPFS and validated through smart contracts.

### Key Features

- 🎓 **LMS Integration**: Connect with existing learning platforms like Elemes
- 🔐 **SIWE Authentication**: Sign-In with Ethereum for secure wallet-based login
- 📜 **NFT Certificates**: Mint verifiable certificates as ERC-721 tokens
- 🌐 **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized storage for certificates and metadata
- 🤖 **Oracle System**: Automated verification and certificate issuance
- ⚡ **Local Development**: Complete local blockchain environment (100% self-hostable)

## 🌐 Live Demo
